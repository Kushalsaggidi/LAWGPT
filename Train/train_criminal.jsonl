The petitioners argued they had raised funds and inducted them into the company as permitted by the lenders, and the lenders' failure to implement the CDR mechanism led to the situation. The High Court, invoking its inherent powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., found merit in the petitioners' contentions regarding the lenders' inaction and their own compliance with the permitted actions, and thus quashed the proceedings.\n- Decision: Proceedings were quashed because the petitioners acted as permitted and the lenders failed to fulfill their obligations.\n\n**Metadata**\n- Category: Criminal: Quash petition\n- Case Type: Criminal\n- Law: Cr.P.C."}]}

The Additional Public Prosecutor informed the court that the petitioner was indeed named as accused No. 25 in an existing FIR covering these charges. Consequently, the court disposed of the petition, granting the petitioner the liberty to file an appropriate petition, indicating that the current petition was not the correct procedural path given the existence of the FIR.\n- Decision: The court allowed the petitioner to file a necessary petition, implicitly denying anticipatory bail in the current proceeding due to the existence of a registered FIR.\n\n**Metadata**\n- Category: Criminal: Anticipatory Bail\n- Case Type: Criminal\n- Law: Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973"}]}
